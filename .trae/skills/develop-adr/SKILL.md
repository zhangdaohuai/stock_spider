# Architecture Decision Record (ADR)

An Architecture Decision Record documents a significant technical decision along with its context and consequences. ADRs capture the "why" behind architectural choices so future team members understand the reasoning — especially important when they question why something was done a particular way. This skill follows Michael Nygard's lightweight ADR format.

## When to Use

- Making significant technical decisions that affect system architecture
- Choosing between technology options (frameworks, databases, services)
- Establishing patterns that future development should follow
- Documenting the rationale for constraints or non-obvious approaches
- Preserving institutional knowledge about past decisions

## Instructions

When asked to create an ADR, follow these steps:

1. **Assign a Number and Title**
   ADRs are numbered sequentially (ADR-001, ADR-002, etc.) for easy reference. The title should be a short noun phrase describing the decision, like "Use PostgreSQL for order data" or "Adopt React for frontend."

2. **Set the Status**
   New ADRs start as "Proposed." After team review, they become "Accepted," "Deprecated," or "Superseded by ADR-XXX." Status changes should be tracked.

3. **Describe the Context**
   Explain the circumstances that led to this decision. What problem are you solving? What forces are at play (technical constraints, team expertise, timeline, cost)? This section should help a reader who wasn't there understand why this decision was needed.

4. **State the Decision**
   Clearly articulate what you decided. Use active voice: "We will use..." rather than "It was decided..." Be specific about what is and isn't included in the decision.

5. **Document the Consequences**
   List the outcomes of this decision — positive, negative, and neutral. Good ADRs are honest about trade-offs. What becomes easier? What becomes harder? What new constraints or options does this create?

## Output Format

Use the template in `references/TEMPLATE.md` to structure the output.

## Quality Checklist

Before finalizing, verify:

- [ ] Title is a short, descriptive noun phrase
- [ ] Status is clearly indicated (Proposed/Accepted/Deprecated/Superseded)
- [ ] Context explains why this decision was needed
- [ ] Decision is stated clearly in active voice
- [ ] Consequences include both positive and negative outcomes
- [ ] ADR can stand alone without requiring other documents

## Examples
