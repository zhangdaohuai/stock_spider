# Release Notes

Release notes communicate product changes to users in a way that highlights value and builds excitement. Unlike changelogs (which document what changed technically), release notes translate changes into user benefits. Good release notes help users discover new capabilities, understand improvements, and trust that issues are being addressed.

## When to Use

- Shipping product updates to customers
- Communicating changes to internal stakeholders
- Preparing app store update descriptions
- Writing customer-facing email announcements
- Documenting changes for support and sales teams

## Instructions

When asked to create release notes, follow these steps:

1. **Gather the Changelog**
   Collect all changes included in this release: features, improvements, and bug fixes. Work from engineering changelogs, completed tickets, or pull request descriptions.

2. **Identify the Highlights**
   Select 1-3 changes that deserve top billing. These should be changes users will notice and care about most. Lead with the most impactful change.

3. **Translate to Benefits**
   Rewrite each change in terms of user value. Instead of "Added pagination to search results," write "Find what you need faster with improved search that handles large result sets." Focus on what users can now do or what's now better.

4. **Categorize Changes**
   Group remaining changes into clear categories: New Features, Improvements, and Bug Fixes. Within each category, order by impact (most valuable first).

5. **Write Scannable Descriptions**
   Each item should be 1-2 sentences. Lead with the benefit, optionally followed by the "how." Users scan release notes — make each line valuable.

6. **Acknowledge Known Issues**
   If there are known limitations or issues, be transparent. Users appreciate honesty, and it reduces support burden.

7. **Tease Coming Soon (Optional)**
   If appropriate, hint at what's coming next. This builds anticipation and shows momentum, but don't over-promise.
